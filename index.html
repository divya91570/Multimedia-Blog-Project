<p><pre><strong>KGF</strong>: KGF Chapter2 was at the time of release the most expensive Kannada film ever made.
     Neel retained the technicians from its predecessor with Bhuvan Gowda handling the 
     cinematography and Ravi Basrur composed the film score and songs. Dutt and Tandon
     joined the cast in early 2019, marking the former's Kannada film debut. Portions 
     of the film were shot simultaneously with Chapter1. Principal photography for the
     rest of the sequences commenced in March 2019, but was halted in March 2020 owing 
     to the COVID-19 lockdown in India. Filming resumed five months later in August 2020
     and was completed in December 2020. Locations included Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mysore
     and Kolar.</pre></p>
